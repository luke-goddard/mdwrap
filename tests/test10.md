1. This person is Edward Gibbon, the author of *The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire*, his most famous work. It is relevant to this class because he introduced the idea of the Roman decline and fall, and created the narrative of Roman ascent from the death of Domitian to the ascension of Commodus, and the decline of Rome in the 3rd century. In this class, we discuss his perspective of *Decline and Fall* and the historian Peter Brown's of continuity, which emphasizes viewing change as change through the citizens' eyes, and not decline.
