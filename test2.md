The story of the Decline and Fall of the Roman empire has been a
classic historical idea for centuries, beginning with Edward Gibbon's
masterwork, *The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire*. He argues
in this that during the third century, the Roman Empire and its
civilization experienced a sharp decline during the 3rd century from
the unprecedented prosperity following the reign of Augustus.  I argue
that, if we define decline to be a loosening of the imperial grip on
the people through the means of religion and culture, the 3rd century
was indeed a time of decline. On the religious front, the advent of
Christianity posed a major threat toward the stability of the state.
Along with this, there was a general decline in the practice of the
Roman virtues, namely in the military. Since the military was key
to maintaining the expansive borders of the Empire, this would have
destructive consequences in the future.

Religion, in the eyes of the Roman state, was not what we perceive
religion to be in the present day. We may think that the state
religion of Paganism required some sort of consistent belief, or
at least a definition of what it was, but that was not the case. In
fact, the Romans did not require anything of the Pagans apart from
sacrifice. Sacrifice was not mystical in nature; it served many
roles in maintaining the social order. For one, it provided a way
for the state to offer solutions to problems it could not solve. If
the rains did not come, offer a sacrifice to Jupiter and everything
will be fine. Even sacrifices served the real purpose of providing
fine, cooked meat to the people. The success of the Empire was, in the
eyes of ancient Romans, intimately tied to sacrifices and obeying the
commands of the gods. This was termed the *Pax Deorum*. However, the
*Pax* was interrupted during the 3rd century as many fled away from
mainstream paganism to join Mystery Cults, or even become Christians.
The phenomenon of mystery cults could be interpreted as a longing
for a more ethereal religion divorced from the worldly, gray nature
of Paganism. For example, the Mithraic Cult claimed to bestow the
ability to enter the world of the gods. "You will hear nothing either
of man or of any other living thing, nor in that hour will you see
anything of mortal affairs of earth, but rather you will see immortal
things" (Mithras Liturgy, 539). It was only required that they say
"PROPROHEGGE MORIOS PROPHYR PROHEGGE NEMTHIRE ARPSENTEN" (Mithras
Liturgy, 561). Although Mystery Cults were not at all incompatible
with mainstream Paganism, their superstitious nature weakened Roman
virtue, and serve as a marker of general decline. The finishing blow
to Paganism, Christianity, also began to make strides during the 3rd
century. Christians, though technically illegal, were left alone for
the most part during the 2nd century. As the Emperor Trajan said "The
Christians are not to be hunted out" (Pliny, Letters 10.97). The state
was only concerned with their destabilizing nature. As Pliny says
of his policy: "I ask them whether they are Christians, if they say
'Yes,' then I repeat the question the second time, and also a third —
warning them of the penalties involved; and if they persist, I order
them away to prison. For I do not doubt that—be their admitted crime
what it may—their pertinacity and inflexible obstinacy surely ought
to be punished" (Pliny, Letters 10.96). It is evident that the rise of
Christianity marked the first time religion, as Romans understood it,
worked against the state instead of supporting it. The intolerance of
the cult of Christ was a blow to the Roman sense of obedience and the
*Pax Deorum*. The Early Christians were, in the eyes of the Pagans,
fanatics. They would take themselves to the grave in order to avoid
recanting their faith or denying their indentity. A notable example
is the Passion of Perpetua and Felicity, which narrates the martyrdom
of a nursing noblewoman and a pregnant slave who refuse to deny the
name of Christ. As Tertullian recounts, "the populace shuddered as
they saw one young woman of delicate frame, and another with breasts
still dropping from her recent childbirth" as they entered the arena.
Stories such as these accelerated the spread of Christianity. The
first widespread resistance and resulting persecuction to the state
by Christians was during the Decian Persecution. The newly elevated
Emperor Decius required a sacrifice from all citizens as an oath
of loyalty. Because Christians are obligated to be monotheistic,
many refused and were persecuted. However, it only lasted 18
months until the Emperor's death. This episode was repeated, though
more deliberately, by Valerian. He ordered all clergy to perform
sacrifices, and all Bishops to death, effectively criminalizing
the church for disturbing the *Pax Deorum*. Cyprian, the Bishop
of Carthage and victim of the persecution said "that [Christian]
senators, distinguished men, and Roman *equites* should lose their
rank and be deprived of their property also; and if when their goods
have been taken away they should persist in being Christian, that they
should then also be punished capitally" (Cyprian, Letters lxxx). Yet
again, the persecution ended by the humiliating capture of Valerian by
Shapur I, the Persian Shah. As Paganism suffered defeat after defeat,
what was once one of the most powerful tools of the state was being
surpassed by a faith that feared no punishments of this world.

As the grip of the state on the populace was being loosened by
Christianity, its control over *itself* was severely tried during
the third century. Roman virtue within the government was overrun by
the most base greediness, as the changes to the process of imperial
succession show. During the Antonine period, precedent was established
for the imperial successor to be chosen by the Emperor based on
exceptional ability. This process yielded the "Five Good Emperors",
under whose rule there was unprecedented prosperity and political
stability. This was broken with Marcus Aurelius's successor Commodus'
assassination, which led to the Year of the Five Emperors, where
five people claimed the title at once. Following the assassination
of Commodus, Pertinax was named Emperor by the Praetorian Guard.
But once Pertinax attempted to initiate reforms that could threaten
the power of the Praetorian Guard, he too was assassinated. Then,
the baseness of the Praetorian Guard was put on full display when
choosing the successor of Pertinax. "For, just as if it had been
in some market or auction room, both the city and its entire Empire
were auctioned off. The sellers were the ones who had slain their
emperor, and the would-be buyers were Sulpicianus and Jelianus, who
vied to outbit each other, one from the inside, the other from the
outside" (Cassius Dio, Roman History LXXIV xi 2-6). The title of
Emperor had been degraded from one of a god, into a money-making
scheme for the Praetorian Guard. The Year of the Five Emperors
ended with Septimius Severus holding power. But even under him and
his Dynasty, the state continued losing control over itself through
declining military discipline. The military was the foundation on
which Rome was able to maintain its grandeur: its expansive borders
and the decadence of its upper class. Taking advantage of the newfound
stability following the turmoil of his acension, Severus pampered his
military to a dangerous point. Herodian recounts, "He bestowed large
donatives on the soldiers, granted them many privileges which they did
not previously have: he was the first to increase their grain ration,
and permitted them to wear gold rings and to live with their wives in
wedlock—all of which used to be considered incompatible with military
discipline and with preparedness and readiness for war. He was the
first to undermine their famous vigor, the austerity of their mode
of life, their acquiescence in hard work, and their well-disciplined
respect for their officers, teaching them to covet money and turning
them aside to luxurious living" (Herodian, History III. viii 4-5).
Though this probably secured his position as Emperor in light of the
instability of the previous year, it weakened the foundation of Roman
self-preservation, and played a role in the territorial decline of
the Empire during the 3rd century. Under Aurelian, the military did
experience a renewal, and borders were expanded. But his reign was
halted by an early death in battle.

We see that when we define the term "decline" in terms of the
decreasing ability of the state to control its people and itself, the
3rd century was indeed a time of decline for the Roman Empire. The
utilitarian state religion of Paganism fell to the superstition of
Mystic Cults and the obstinacy of Christianity, leading the state to
persecute its own people, including senators and those of high rank.
But the chaos was not isolated to the populace. The Emperor began to
lose control over the Praetorian Guard and the military, resulting
in territorial loss and splitting the Empire during the 3rd century
crisis. Though partially solved by Aurelian, the overall change was
one of decline.
